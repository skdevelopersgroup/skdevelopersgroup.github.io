            <p class="running_text">Bay 4 is a luxury 3BHK residential apartment project located at Kavery Nagar Main road, Kottivakkam in Chennai. Nothing compares with new, and this one will be all set to go once we are through with the ﬁnal touch up. These 3BHK apartments are exquisitely designed and will directly face the beach. Thus, our valued occupants will begin their days with pleasant sunrise and end them with equally soothing sunsets.</p>
 <p class="running_text">Apart from its excellent design, what is particularly appealing about these apartments is its ﬂooring which differs for every room. Embellished with Italian ﬂooring and vitriﬁed tiles, these apartments shall be every resident’s dream house.To ensure that the joy in the lives of our residents reﬂects upon their homes too, we have decided to give the internal walls a putty ﬁnish with premium emulsion paints. With the external walls adorned with a textured ﬁnish, these apartments shall carry a slight touch of opulence. With the bathroom walls in these apartments tiled up to ceiling height, every corner of this property is designed to emit majesty.Built with a state-of-the-art facility, these apartments will be supplemented with the lift facility and will carry up to six people at a time.  These apartments will be installed with generators that provide hundred percent power backup to ensure that the residents never have to suffer from any power outages.</p>
  <p class="running_text">
While it is necessary to give every structure a solid foundation, it is equally signiﬁcant that the area around that structure is safe too. To this end, the entire premise of the building will be enabled by CCTV which shall be connected to the Intercom facility. Thus, we seek to ensure that the occupants are safe not only within the walls of their apartments but also enjoy utmost security outside their houses in the building premise. Built using state of the art technique, we plan to complete and hand over these awe-inspiring residential apartments to our valued customers by the end of 2019.</p>

            <p class="running_text">We seek to develop 140 independent houses at Siruseri, Thiruporur Taluk in Kancheepuram district over an area of 5.2 acres. Currently, in its approval stage, these houses will be completed by Ruan Construction Pvt. Ltd (Group Company). These independent housing facilities are quite economical and can, therefore, be afforded by the middle-income groups. Thus, we look forward to giving people an excellent housing experience at affordable rates.</p>
<p class="running_text">            
This project shall have a transformer to deal with the issue of power outages. A vast park with jogging track would ensure that the residents have ample opportunities for recreation. Also, playing area for children with badminton and tennis court in 16,000 sq. Ft. would keep the kids occupied and healthy. The residents of these apartments would have access to all modern-day amenities like STP, association ofﬁce room, and security room.</p>
<p class="running_text">
To give these modern-day marvels a touch of sophistication, the bedrooms, kitchens, and the bathrooms shall all have different ﬂoorings. The internal walls in these houses will have a wall putty with emulsion which is sure to liven up everyone’s mood in any situation. Through a 24/7 borewell water supply, we make sure that our residents never feel wanting for the biggest life-sustaining necessity.
As experienced real estate developers who know our trade, we completely understand how crucial it is to meet every electricity-related safety parameter strictly. Thus, we shall ensure that quality copper wire is used in concealed conductors with concealed switchboards and modular switches. The three-phase power supply in these apartments would be further supplemented with a generator that will serve as the power backup for motor pumps and will be used for lighting all streets. With our customers waiting eagerly for us to deliver these beautiful state of the art architectures to them.</p>
